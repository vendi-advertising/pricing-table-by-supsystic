Pricing tables are used as a way to illustrate how features of a product differ as the price changes.

Pricing tables must be chosen very carefully so that visitors should get the information they would be interested in. Available features, options and costs available as well as refund. Price tables by Supsytic with nice templates and drag-and-drop builder are totally unique and less used for you to integrate plugin easily on your website.

When you create your pricing table, it is good to consider the following points:

* Visually separate plans in pricing table by using alternating background colours. You can attract attention to the plan that you want to be bought by user.
* Utilize different price table font sizes and colours for elements you want to stand out: titles, prices plan, headlines, etc.
* Be aware that users scroll down long tables. Prices at the top of a pricing table might not be visible when they’ve reached the table bottom. One solution is to place prices both at the top and bottom – another is to keep the pricing table short.

= Pricing Table Drag-and-Drop Builder =

The Pricing Table Drag-and-Drop builder allows you to showcase the prices for your product, services, or packages in a beautiful and responsive pricing table. Design your pricing table just as you wish. Allows you to choose an icon which you can insert beside your header, add pricing table rows and columns, or enlarge a pricing column where you would like to emphasize a certain price.

In the pricing table user should carefully examine its portfolio and pick the most important features to present in its pricing plans. Visitors should be given only the information they would be interested in: available price features, options and costs. The rule of thumb is: every unnecessary cell in your pricing table increases the probability of losing potential customers, because you make it more difficult for them to compare various price plans and select the best one.

== Other Notes ==

The price table is a great way to show information about various prices for its products or services, especially, some hosting company, they need to present the pricing table of each plan clearly on pricing table to easy for users to looking. Those pricing table should content text and features description easy users reading information of each price table level has to offer in a table format. Depending on the contents of the price chart, the pricing tables can be good for organizing many other types of data for deep clarity other than price like comparison table.

= Pricing Table Structure =

Most of the pricing tables are horizontal because it’s easier to compare the offers and see features. That doesn’t mean you should always use the horizontal pricing table layout, though. It really depends on the variety and complexity of the price plans information you want to display in the pricing table chart. Best practice is to use a horizontal table solution when you have to display a lot of features and a vertical one when you don’t have a lot of plans to offer and you’re not planning to include a long list of features in your pricing table.

= Pricing Table Design =

Design can do one of two things to your business – either sink it or raise it to the top. You have to be very careful when designing a pricing chart. Fonts, headlines, layout of pricing table – it all has to be balanced and done neatly. Furthermore you have to make sure the pricing chart’s design works with the main site. However don’t forget about your main goal. In pricing tables, design is just a tool to achieve your objectives, namely – increase sales. Simplicity is the key to success of price chart. Remember that you’re not creating a collage for school, you’re creating a price table design for a specific reason. Don’t clutter your chart with unnecessary elements. A common mistake is to write down a list of features most of the plans in the pricing table don’t offer and then put dozens of red crosses in your pricing table chart. Consumers don’t want to see what you’re not offering, they want to see what you’ve got and for what price.

= Comparison Table =

Adding a pricing or product comparison table to your website makes it easier for your visitors to come to a decision on whether to make purchase or not, giving them the ability to compare prices and features at a glance.

Offering your own products with coparison table in a number of packages can also help increase the amount of revenue that is generated. These versions and upgrades can then be displayed in a comparison table. Also by comparing the products you are promoting against the competition, you can let your visitors do their research on your site, and increase the chances of them making a purchase through your affiliate link, rather than going elsewhere. Create comparison table from any pricing template with image or video embeding.
